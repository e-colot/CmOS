# TODO

- Implement a contiguous allocation mode
- Measure impact of page size
- Compare type of file storage
- implement a first process management algorithm
- implement different process management algorithms
- compare process management algorithms
- revisit ISA
## Contiguous allocation
    - [x] disk init 
    - [x] FAT setup
    - [ ] File insertion
    - [ ] File removal
    - [ ] File displacement
    - [ ] Disk defragmentation

# Known issues

might remove memPos from diskRead (obsolete argument)
